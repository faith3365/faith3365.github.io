	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hey, My name is Faith and I am a sophmore biology major. I am a little shy when you first meet me, but as I get more comfortable I grow out of my shell. I enjoy hanging out with my friends in my free time and also going out on the weekend. I have a one year old cat named, milo, who is basically my child, however he is very energetic and enjoys biting and scratching more than anything. I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts with my parents and two siblings and my childhood cat. </p>
		<p id="talk" class="hide">When choosing where to go to school I knew I wanted to go far to have the feeling of truly living on my own, and also I was craving warmer weather year-roud as winter in Massachusetts is so long and shoveling snow is not enjoyable at all. I began to settle on South Carolina because of the marching band, they gave a large scholarship that made the price a lot more realistic. Coming to South Carolina I joined the marching band and made a ton of friends. Moving so far away, this school gave me a home away from home which is truly what I wanted.</p>

	<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
		<p>As previosuly mentioned I am currently a biology major with a minor in foresic science. Originally I came to college wanted to pursue medical school, however as I began college I realized I could not see myself continuing on with school for the amount of time medical school needs. From there I had to figure out what other career path was interesting to me. First, I picked up a minor of criminal justice knowing I wanted to do somthing with solving criminal cases. However, as I continued to figure out what I wanted to do I realized that I wanted to contiue working in a lab, so I switched my minor to forensic science which focuses more on the lab part of this career.</p>
		<p id="talks" class="hide">So, with this major and minor I have settles on a career in forensic biology. Forensic biology. specifically in a crime lab, is a career where you work in a lab analyzing things like DNA in order to help solve crimes. Helping to solve crimes is appealing to me as it gives me a purpose that I am helping people by identifying the identity of criminals. </p>
